## 1. Background

The rapid growth of online platforms like YouTube, Instagram, X (Twitter), and Facebook has transformed content creation into a highly competitive space. Individuals and small businesses often struggle to optimize their content for maximum reach and engagement due to the complexity of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) techniques and tools.

Current tools for SEO are either costly, overly complex, or not tailored to specific needs such as niche analysis, content idea generation, or multimedia content optimization. As a result, there is a growing need for a user-friendly, cost-effective application that leverages AI to simplify SEO-driven content creation for personal use.

The project, **A.high.summit**, aims to address these gaps by developing an AI-powered application that offers practical SEO guidance. This tool will evolve incrementally to become a scalable and robust solution, empowering users to create highly optimized content tailored to their goals. The application focuses on open-source technologies and modular development to ensure accessibility and cost-efficiency.
